## Description

My motivation to complete this was from having already completed project 1. This made me feel confident with how I can access data from the API and plug it in wherever needed. I built this to solidify my understanding with not only API's, but javascriot, jquery, css, html & bootstrap. This allows users to access a website where they can easily search weather anywhere in the world with a user friendly interface. I learned that the simplest fix could be making sure you add the correct class to every element, after you have stared at your code for an hour wondering why it wasn't working!üòÖ
