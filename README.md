## Description

My motivation to complete this was from having already completed project 1. This made me feel confident with how I can access data from the API and plug it in wherever needed. I built this to solidify my understanding with not only API's, but javascriot, jquery, css, html & bootstrap. This allows users to access a website where they can easily search weather anywhere in the world with a user friendly interface. I learned that the simplest fix could be making sure you add the correct class to every element, after you have stared at your code for an hour wondering why it wasn't working!üòÖ

## Usage

Home page to the weather dashboard<br>

On the right, there is an input for the city and search button<br>

Enter in city you'd like to see current & future weather for<br>
<img width="1280" alt="seattle inputted in search bar" src="./readmeimgs/seattle search.png"><br>
<br>
After you click search, it will bring up the current conditions for that city & below the 5 day forecast<br>

<br>
<img width="1280" alt="seattle future conditions" src="./readmeimgs/seattle 5 day forecast.png"><br>
<br>
You can complete as many searches as you'd like<br>
<img width="1280" alt="new york inputted in search bar" src="./readmeimgs/new york search.png"><br>
<br>
After you click search, it will bring up the current conditions for the next city & below the 5 day forecast<br>
<img width="1280" alt="new york current conditions" src="./readmeimgs/new york current.png"><br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="new york future conditions" src="./readmeimgs/new york 5 day forcast.png"><br>
<br>
In the Nav bar, there is a dropdown option called 'Previously searched'.<br>
<img width="1280" alt="nav bar" src="./readmeimgs/nav bar.png"><br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="previously searched dropdown" src="./readmeimgs/previoussearch dropdown.png"><br>
<br>
Once clicked, all previous searches appear<br>
<img width="1280" alt="previously searched dropdown" src="./readmeimgs/seattle ny dropdown.png"><br>
<br>
From there if you want to see the weather for one of those cities again, you can click the dropdown item and it will bring that cities information back up<br>
<img width="1280" alt="seattle current conditions" src="./readmeimgs/seattle current.png"><br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="seattle future conditions" src="./readmeimgs/seattle 5 day forecast.png"><br>
<br>
If you click the weather button in the Navbar, it will refresh the page and bring you back to the starting homepage.<br>
<img width="1280" alt="nav bar" src="./readmeimgs/nav bar.png"><br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="Weather button in navbar" src="./readmeimgs/refresh to homepage.png"><br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="weather dashboard homepage" src="./readmeimgs/homepage.png"><br>
<br>
Lastly, in the footer, there is a link to the API I used if you want to check it out<br>
<img width="1280" alt="webpage footer" src="./readmeimgs/footer.png"><br>
<br>
It will take you right to their webpage where you can look into it more
